Hello and welcome to my repository for all of my smart contracts I will be writing while going through the 
Learn Solidity, Blockchain Development, & Smart Contracts | Powered By AI - Full Course by Patrick Collins.

The first video (lessons 0-6) can be found here: 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umepbfKp5rI&list=PLmgt1IrTPD0vQuG7c4wUQp_RxyRkDVvC1&index=5&t=33s

This repo is for my beginner / practice contracts I am going to do throughout the course. I will try to keep
this as updated as possible as my goal is to log the contracts I write in an effort to apply what I learned in the 
lessons with little help; kind of a knowledge check, if you will.

Enjoy!

1.a. Counter.sol
- a simple counter contract, increase/decrease by 1

1.b. CounterCondition.sol
- a "counter version 2", if you will; increase by 1, but on decreasing, it checks the count first: if 0, then you get an error
